# NodeJS Bookshelf API

Welcome to the NodeJS Bookshelf API! This project serves as my submission to complete the course as a backend developer at Dicoding. In this project, we dive into the world of Node.js and build a powerful Bookshelf API that allows users to manage their book collections. Leveraging the robustness and scalability of Node.js, we create a seamless and efficient API that enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their bookshelf.



## Tech Stack

**Server:** NodeJS v18, hapi, uuid, nodemon, eslint
